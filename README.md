# Early_Drowsiness_Detection_of_Drivers_and_Prevent_Road_Accidents

 - use pytorch and yoloV5 to detect drowsiness
 - i created own custom data dataset
 - this model detect open/closed eyes and yawn/not_yawn
 - if more than 5 frame have closed eyes aur yawn then it will alert driver

### notes :-
 - clone yoloV5 and put custom.yaml and testing.yaml inside yoloV5 folder
 - clone LabelImg and replace predefined_classes.txt inside /LabelImg/data folder
